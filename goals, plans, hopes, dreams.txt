[] = tentative assigned person.

popout = tweetview/profileview
column = column with list of tweets
panel = accounts or timeline

Goals for 3.0
- Gapless Tweets: always get the # of tweets needed to get up to date. no set limit [Funkatron?]
- Use Accounts panel to add/remove columns. [Tibfib]
	- Custom Searches (also, allow more than one search per column!) [Tibfib + Funkatron]
- Allow users to clear seen tweets
- tapping search button brings up popout, from there people can decide if they want to save the search as a column [Tibfib]
- Compose ... what to do, options: 
	- Have a dialog in middle of screen. scrim over other elements 
- Tweet Translation
- Conversation view in tweet view (option to auto load)
- Embedded images? (could work pretty well with Virtual List and its gradual loading of items... call function, passing callback and row index. callback refreshes row index ..
- Advanced Gestures
	- two finger to top/bottom
- Filter by keyword
- Timeline marker. 
	- could go with gapless tweets.
	- 2fing scroll goes to timeline marker, then top/bottom

- Timed tweets (if there is another service with an api available)

Later 
- Themes
- Syncing with other version of Spaz
